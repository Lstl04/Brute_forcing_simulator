# Brute Force Simulator

This project is a simple web application that simulates brute force attacks using a Python backend with Flask and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides options to test a directory brute-force and a password brute-force. The password can contain letters (capital or not) and numbers (no symbol) for the password brute force, but can contain symbol as well for the directory brute force. 
Little heads up: Brute Force attack on password others than pin numbers (all number password) aren't efficient so if your password gets larger than 6 or 7 characters, you're gonna be there for a while. This project was more of a personnal challenge than a computing feat as there are a lot of very effective craking program that use more complex algorithm that brute force.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:
      ```sh
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```sh
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install flask flask-cors
    ```

## Usage

### Starting the Backend Server

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2. **Run the Flask application**:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

### Accessing the Frontend

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

### Testing the Application

1. Enter a password in the input field.
2. Click on "Password Brute Force" to simulate a password brute force attack.
3. Click on "Directory Brute Force" to simulate a directory brute force attack.
4. The results will be displayed below the buttons.
